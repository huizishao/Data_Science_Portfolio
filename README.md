### Project 2 - Disaster Response Webapp

**Description:**

In this project, I analyzed the disaster data from Figure Eight and built a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The data set containning real that were sent during disaster events.I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency. It also include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

### Project 3 - Recommendation systems with IBM

**Description:**

In this project, I developed a recommendation engine's algorithm with IBM communities articles and user interactions. This project will serve as a prototype of the recommender systems of the article recommendation systems of IBM. 

The project will be hosted on

### Capstone Project - Sparkify Music Service Analytics

**Description:**

In the capstone project, I utilized the user information logs for music steaming service to build machine learning models and predict the churning possibilities of a user and understand the features that contribute to the churning behaviors of the users.
