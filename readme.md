# Understanding the Bike Sharing System from 2018–2019

**Project Motivation**

For this project, I was interestested in using 2018 - 2019 Ford Go-Bike bike sharing system to analyze the interesting stories behind data. Questions as follow are answered.

* What is the distribution of the duration of biking in minutes?
* Which Age group get more rides for biking?
* What is the Gender distribution for each Age group?
* What is the Market growth of the Bike Sharing system?

**Installation**

No extra besides the built-in libraries from Anaconda needed to run this project

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* glob
* os

**File Descriptions**

* data: Ford goBike Data is available: [Ford goBike Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html">)

* Bike sharing analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for the main analytics

* Bike sharing analysis.html: HTML file for the JUpyter Notebook

**Results**

The main takeaways from this analytics are

* The duration (min) of the bike riding is normal distribution with mean of 10 minutes
* The main user groups for the bike-sharing is 30–40 and 20–30 years old and the male dominate the market
* The market growing quickly from 2018 to 2019, with a big drop in Novenmber 2018

Specific findings of the code can be found at the Jupyter Notebook and blog post below.
